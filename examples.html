                    <h3>User Managerment Tool</h3>
                    <p>This started off as a technical exercise for a interview that
                    I took as a way to learn more bootstrap and angular. It is a basic user managerment system with 
                    the ability to add, delete and update user data. It needs to be expanded to check for duplicate users.
                    It uses a mix of jQuery, Angular and boostrap on the front end and the API that modifies the data is written in PHP.
                    The PHP section just uses a file to store the user data in a json file. It may eventually be updated to use a database
                    for storing user data as this would be better.

                    <p>This started off as a technical exercise for a interview that
                    I took as a way to learn more bootstrap as it is not something I got
                  to use a lot. There is also some angular on the page to control a few of the features
                as this was part of the exercise. Only some mock data was provided so most of the tabs
              are empty unfortunately so alot of the options are placeholders but it was more about the layout than
                the data itself.

                    <p>This is a new version of the movie search app found below but
                      this was rewrtten to use Angular only, there is no PHP used in this version.
                      It is my first real angular project and it is a one page application
                      so there is no page reloading. It still sues the same API on the back end
                    but the angular processes the JSON response and then uses it to build
                  HTML to show on the page.</p>

                    <p>This uses a plugin for jQuery called the basic jQuery slider.
                        It creates a slide show of images that is defined in a
                        list and has a function attached to it to create the
                        animation. this plugin was found through my job at SLI
                        as one of the clients was using it and I had to solve
                        a few issues we were having with it so I had to look
                        into it. It is showing a images from my trip to
                        New Zealand.

                        and displays them on this website. I have recently updated this to use
                      angularJS. There is a PHP file that fetches the JSON data from the twitter API
                    and then uses angular to process this response and create the HTML displayed</p>

                    <p>This was originally an assessment as part of an E-Commerce module.
                        The task was to create a blog system that allowed an admin to attach
                        files to a post so they could be sold to users. Only users with an
                        account are able to see and buy the files. The project uses PHP, MySQL,
                        HTML and CSS. It uses a PDO object to access the database of users and posts.
                        The payment system is an integration of the Google Checkout libraries. Sadly google
                      discontinued google checkout in 2013 so this functionality no longer works. </p>
