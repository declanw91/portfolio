          <h3>Video Game Quiz</h3>
          <p>
            This project is my first experience using the VueJS framework and is based on a tutorial that I was following
            to learn the basic concepts and get some experience in using the framework. The questions are provided by 
            a third party API that returns the question, a list of possible answers and, of course, the correct answer.
            The project has two main components, the first is the header component at the top of the page showing the logo, the number of questions answered
            and the total correct answers and the second is the questionbox component which displays the question, the answers and handles the user's interaction
            with it and the submit and next buttons. The project does need a few updates and I plan to
            update it as I learn more about the framework.

          <h3>User Managerment Tool</h3>
          <p>This started off as a technical exercise for a interview that
            I took as a way to learn more bootstrap and angular. It is a basic user managerment system with 
            the ability to add, delete and update user data. It needs to be expanded to check for duplicate users.
            It uses a mix of jQuery, Angular and boostrap on the front end and the API that modifies the data is written in PHP.
            The PHP section just uses a file to store the user data in a json file. It may eventually be updated to use a database
            for storing user data as this would be better.

            <p>This was an assessment at university and was my first experience with jQuery.
                The task was to create a page that allowed users to select modules
                for a welding course. The jQuery library is used to limit the selections
                based on the rules for the course. </p>

          <p>Another API based project using APIs from LastFM to fetch my last played
              tracks and my top artists, albums and tracks. There there several ajax requests in the background that call 
              php scripts that get the data and return it as json. The front end uses angularJS to then display this information.
              The dropdown then triggers a show/hide of templates in AngularJS to show each area.

          <p>This is a simple version of casino blackjack that is created using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This started as 
            a technical test for an interview and grew from there to be a little more graphical. It still needs some work as I 
            want to improve it a little by using templating tools like MustacheJs but haven't put that part in yet.

            <p>Been looking into different APIs and started to experiment
                with them. This page uses the twitter API to fetch my tweets
                and displays them on this website. I have recently updated this to use
              angularJS. There is a PHP file that fetches the JSON data from the twitter API
            and then uses angular to process this response and create the HTML displayed</p>

              so there is no page reloading. It uses an API fom TheMovieDB on the back end
            to make a request for data after the user types in their search and submits, the angular then processes the JSON response and then 
            uses it to build HTML to show on the page.</p>

            <p>This uses a plugin for jQuery called bxslider.
                It creates a slide show of images with controls for scrolling through each of them. I learnt about this while working at a previous
                job as I had to set it up for several sites that wanted to have product carousels on some of their pages. It meant I had to
                research the plugin and the available options to set it up for each client. The slideshow is showing a few random xbox screenshots.

          <p>This is an angular version of my original php based wine store (see the example below this one to see the original). It still uses some PHP and MySQL
            to fetch the wine data from the database and then convert it into json. The angular part takes over from there as the site uses angular to display
            the data and control all of the requried functionality needed to make a newer, more shiny version of my store.

            It uses a PDO object to access the database of wines.

            This project is a version of this sites home page that uses a php templating tool called Smarty which started as a technical test for an interview. It pulls data from my blog using php and then will
            use a smarty template to render the response. There are two files, the first is a normal php script that fetchs the data and then the second is a template file 
            where the html for the page is found. In here you define the HTML to use and the file contains a section (a foreach loop) that goes throug heach of the posts
            returned and creates the html that is used to display each post. The main page of this site uses the same feed but uses angular instead to show the posts.
