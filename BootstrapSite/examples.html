                    <h3>Picture Slideshow</h3>
                    <p>This uses a plugin for jQuery called the basic jQuery slider.
                        It creates a slide show of images that is defined in a 
                        list and has a function attached to it to create the
                        animation. this plugin was found through my job at SLI
                        as one of the clients was using it and I had to solve
                        a few issues we were having with it so I had to look
                        into it. It is showing a images from my trip to
                        New Zealand.

                        tracks and my top artists, albums and tracks. It uses
                        a drop down menu to send AJAX requests to the server
                        to load up the appropriate chart. Each chart is an XML
                        request through the API that returns and is then processed
                        by the PHP script before being loaded onto the page.

                        and displays them on this website. It uses the XML

                    <h3> Online Seller Blog System </h3>
                    <p>This was originally an assessment as part of an E-Commerce module.
                        The task was to create a blog system that allowed an admin to attach
                        files to a post so they could be sold to users. Only users with an
                        account are able to see and buy the files. The project uses PHP, MySQL, 
                        HTML and CSS. It uses a PDO object to access the database of users and posts.
                        The payment system is an integration of the Google Checkout libraries.</p>

                        sold wine and create an online storefront for it. Users have their own
                        shopping cart to keep track of their current purchases. The project 
                        uses PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and PHP Sessions. It uses a PDO object to

                        The task was to create a page that allowed users to select modules
                        for a welding course. The jQuery library is used to limit the selections
